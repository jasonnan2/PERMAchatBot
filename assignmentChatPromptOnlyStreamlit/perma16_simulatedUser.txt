Positivity**\n*   **Justification:** This domain ranks highest due to the strong negative correlation of **Gratitude** (Rank 3, CORR -0.4145). This is the most impactful variable with a strong negative correlation in the dataset, indicating that higher gratitude is significantly associated with lower depression. Individuals experiencing high depression reported a lower mean gratitude score (5.667) compared to those with low depression (6.143).\n*   **Recommendation:** Dedicate 5-10 minutes each day to a gratitude practice. This could involve writing down 3-5 things you are grateful for in a journal or simply reflecting on them.\n\n**2. Sleep**\n*   **Justification:** Sleep is moderately important based on **Sleep_percent** (Rank 7, CORR -0.0899). While the correlation is weak, it is negative, suggesting that a higher percentage of time spent asleep in bed is associated with slightly lower depression. Individuals with high depression had a mean Sleep_percent of 88.214%, slightly lower than the 90.606% for those with low depression.\n*   **Recommendation:** Aim for a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Try to incorporate a relaxing activity, like reading or a warm bath, 30 minutes before bed.\n\n**3. Diet**\n*   **Justification:** Diet ranks low due to the single relevant variable, **past_day_sugars** (Rank 5, CORR 0.0953). This variable shows a *positive* correlation with depression, meaning higher sugar intake is associated with higher depression. This incurs a penalty and does not align with prioritizing strong negative correlations for positive change. Individuals with high depression consumed slightly less sugar (2.036 portions) than those with low depression (2.242 portions), but the overall positive correlation suggests that reducing sugar may be beneficial.\n*   **Recommendation:** Gradually reduce daily sugar intake. Start by swapping one sugary drink or snack (e.g., soda, candy bar) with a healthier alternative like water, fruit, or a small handful of nuts.\n\n**4. Exercise**\n*   **Justification:** Exercise ranks last. Despite having multiple relevant variables, the most highly ranked ones, **cumm_step_distance** (Rank 2, CORR 0.4570), **cumm_step_speed** (Rank 4, CORR 0.1509), and **past_day_exercise_mild** (Rank 10, CORR 0.3060), all show *positive* correlations with depression. This is a significant penalty, indicating that for this individual, higher levels of these specific exercise metrics are associated with *higher* depression. The only negatively correlated variable, **heart_rate** (Rank 9, CORR -0.1128), has a weak correlation and a low rank. This data suggests that current exercise patterns may not be effectively mitigating depression or could even be contributing to it for this individual.\n*   **Recommendation:** Shift focus from solely targeting high step counts or speed, which currently correlate positively with depression, to incorporating enjoyable, low-intensity activities. Consider gentle stretching, mindful walking in nature, or beginner-friendly yoga sessions. The goal is to find forms of movement that feel good and support well-being, rather than pushing for metrics that currently show an unhelpful association with mood."
