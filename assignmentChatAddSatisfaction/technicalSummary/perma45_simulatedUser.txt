Exercise (Rank 1)**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Exercise domain is prioritized due to having the highest number of actionable variables (6) and strong evidence for positive change. `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 7) shows a medium negative correlation (-0.2238) with depression, indicating that increasing moderate exercise is associated with lower depression. For high depression, moderate exercise averages 0.145 hours, compared to 0.317 hours for low depression. Additionally, `past_day_exercise_strenuous` (Rank 9) and `cumm_step_calorie` (Rank 10) show trends of lower values in high depression, suggesting that increasing these activities could be beneficial. While `cumm_step_speed` has a weak positive correlation, the overall strength and number of beneficial variables make Exercise the most impactful domain. `Exercise_satisfaction` is already at its maximum (5.0), showing high satisfaction regardless of depression level.\n*   **Recommendation:** Gradually increase your daily moderate-intensity exercise. Aim to increase your moderate exercise duration from the current average of 0.145 hours to closer to 0.317 hours per day. Consider adding 15-20 minutes of brisk walking, jogging, or cycling to your routine. Also, explore ways to increase strenuous exercise and overall calories burned through physical activity.\n\n**2. Positivity (Rank 2)**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Positivity domain ranks second primarily due to `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 24), which demonstrates a medium negative correlation (-0.2216) with depression. This indicates that higher satisfaction with social connections is associated with lower depression. While the mean satisfaction for high depression is already high at 4.935 (compared to 5.0 for low depression), there is still a small room for improvement. `Reflect_activetime` (Rank 6) shows a weak positive correlation (0.0877), with higher values in high depression (6673.714 msec) compared to low depression (3352.000 msec), which incurs a small penalty. However, the clear positive impact potential of `Connect_satisfaction` is significant.\n*   **Recommendation:** Focus on enhancing your satisfaction with social connections. Engage in meaningful interactions with friends, family, or community members. Strive to maintain or increase your connection satisfaction by actively participating in social activities that bring you joy and a sense of belonging.\n\n**3. Sleep (Rank 3)**\n\n*   **Justification:** Despite `Sleep_percent` holding the highest overall rank (Rank 1) with a strong positive correlation (0.5985), the Sleep domain ranks third. The data shows that a higher `Sleep_percent` (98.065% for high depression) is associated with *higher* depression compared to a lower percentage (88.000% for low depression). Interpreting `Sleep_percent` as the proportion of time spent asleep while in bed, an excessively high percentage may indicate spending too much sedentary time in bed due to depression symptoms. Thus, reducing this percentage (e.g., by not lingering in bed when awake) can be a positive behavioral change. However, this domain lacks any variables with negative correlations to depression, resulting in a large penalty according to the guidelines, which reduces its overall priority despite the high rank of `Sleep_percent`. `Sleep_satisfaction` (Rank 20) also shows a weak positive correlation (0.155).\n*   **Recommendation:** Work on optimizing your time spent in bed. Focus on developing a consistent sleep schedule and getting out of bed when you are awake. Aim to reduce any unnecessary sedentary time spent in bed beyond the duration of actual sleep, which may be contributing to higher `Sleep_percent` values associated with increased depression.\n\n**4. Diet (Rank 4)**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Diet domain is ranked last. It contains only one actionable variable in the provided data, `Diet_satisfaction`. This variable has a medium negative correlation (-0.213) with depression, which is generally positive. However, `Diet_satisfaction` is already at its maximum value of 5.0 for both high and low depression, indicating no direct room for improvement through intervention on this specific metric. The other specified actionable diet variables (`past_day_fats`, `past_day_sugars`) were not present in the provided dataset, leaving no clear path for actionable dietary changes based on the available information.\n*   **Recommendation:** Based on the provided data, there are no specific actionable recommendations for dietary changes to reduce depression, as diet satisfaction is already optimal, and other relevant diet variables were not available."
