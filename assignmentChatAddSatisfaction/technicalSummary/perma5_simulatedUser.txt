Exercise (Rank 1)**\n\n*   **Justification:** This domain is prioritized due to `past_day_exercise_mild` being a highly ranked variable (Rank 4) with a **strong negative correlation** to depression (-0.575). During high depression, mild exercise is 0.00 hours, compared to 0.562 hours during low depression. Additionally, `Exercise_satisfaction` (Rank 13) has a medium negative correlation (-0.351) and is very low during high depression (1.90 on a 1-5 scale), indicating a strong opportunity for improvement.\n*   **Recommendation:** Gradually introduce mild exercise into your routine. Start with 20-30 minutes of mild activity (e.g., a brisk walk, gentle cycling, or yoga) 3-4 times per week, aiming to increase frequency and duration as comfort allows. Setting achievable goals will also help improve `Exercise_satisfaction`.\n\n**2. Sleep (Rank 2)**\n\n*   **Justification:** The `Sleep_percent` variable (Rank 2) shows a notable difference, with 83.5% sleep percentage during high depression compared to 93.5% during low depression. `Sleep_satisfaction` (Rank 12) also shows a medium negative correlation (-0.350) and is lower during high depression (3.15 vs 3.90). These indicate a clear link between sleep quality and depressive states.\n*   **Recommendation:** Focus on improving your sleep efficiency and satisfaction. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at similar times daily. Implement a relaxing bedtime routine to enhance `Sleep_satisfaction`, aiming to increase the percentage of time you are asleep while in bed to above 90%.\n\n**3. Diet (Rank 3)**\n\n*   **Justification:** `past_day_fats` (Rank 3) and `past_day_sugars` (Rank 5) are both higher during periods of high depression (fats: 1.00 portions vs 0.55; sugars: 1.10 portions vs 0.45). While correlations are weak positive, these values indicate that reducing intake could be beneficial. `Diet_satisfaction` (Rank 19) is also consistently low (2.00 during high depression), signaling dissatisfaction.\n*   **Recommendation:** Make small, positive changes to reduce your intake of fats and sugars. Start by identifying one or two opportunities each day to swap a high-fat or high-sugar item for a healthier alternative (e.g., choosing water over soda, a piece of fruit over a processed snack).\n\n**4. Positivity (Rank 4)**\n\n*   **Justification:** This domain is ranked last due to conflicting data. Variables like `Connect_chatpeople` (Rank 6), `Gratitude` (Rank 9), and `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 20) all show positive correlations with depression. This means that, for you, higher engagement in these activities or higher satisfaction with connections is associated with *increased* depression. This runs contrary to typical positive lifestyle recommendations and incurs a penalty, making it a lower priority based on this specific data.\n*   **Recommendation:** Given the current data showing counter-intuitive associations for this domain, it is not recommended to actively increase these specific positivity-related activities at this time. Focus on the other domains where the data clearly supports beneficial changes."
