Your satisfaction with connections is significantly lower during high depression (Mean: 2.034) compared to low depression (Mean: 3.032), strongly prioritizing this area.\n        *   `Connect_chattime` (Rank 7, CORR -0.407): This variable has a strong negative correlation. During high depression, your average chattime (0.284 Hrs) is less than half of what it is during low depression (0.589 Hrs).\n        *   `Connect_chatpeople` (Rank 10, CORR -0.416): Another variable with a strong negative correlation. You connect with fewer people when depression is high (Mean: 0.621 people) compared to low depression (Mean: 1.290 people).\n    *   **Recommendations:** Focus on proactively engaging in social connections.\n        *   **Increase Chat Time:** Aim to gradually increase the time you spend chatting with others, perhaps by 15-30 minutes per day, reaching out to friends or family.\n        *   **Expand Social Circle:** Make an effort to connect with a wider range of people, even if it's just reaching out to one more person per day than usual. This could be through online groups, community activities, or simply a quick call to an acquaintance.\n\n2.  **Exercise (Rank 2)**\n\n    *   **Justification:** This domain has one high-ranking, medium-impact variable.\n        *   `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 3, CORR -0.229): This is a medium negative correlation and a highly ranked variable. Your moderate exercise duration is significantly lower during high depression (Mean: 0.034 Hrs) compared to low depression (Mean: 0.177 Hrs).\n        *   `past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 8, CORR -0.148): The correlation is weak (ignored per rules). The difference in means between high (0.328 Hrs) and low depression (0.331 Hrs) is negligible, indicating minimal impact.\n    *   **Recommendations:** Focus on incorporating more moderate exercise.\n        *   **Gradual Moderate Activity:** Start with short, consistent bouts of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, dancing, or cycling. Aim for at least 15-20 minutes of moderate activity 3-4 times a week, gradually building up as tolerated.\n\n3.  **Sleep (Rank 3)**\n\n    *   **Justification:** While sleep is crucial, the available data only shows a weak link with depression.\n        *   `Sleep_percent` (Rank 5, CORR -0.021): This correlation is weak (ignored per rules). Although your sleep percentage is slightly lower in high depression (Mean: 70.517%) than in low depression (Mean: 73.710%), the weak correlation suggests it is not a primary driver based on this data.\n    *   **Recommendations:** Focus on improving overall sleep hygiene.\n        *   **Consistent Sleep Habits:** Establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to rest (dark, quiet, cool). Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n\n4.  **Diet (Rank 4)**\n\n    *   **Justification:** No relevant variables from the 'Diet' domain were present in your provided data.\n    *   **Recommendations:** While no specific data points were available, a balanced diet generally supports overall well-being.\n        *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Focus on incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your meals. Limit processed foods, excessive sugars, and unhealthy fats for general health benefits."
