        "content": "Here are the ranked intervention domains and actionable recommendations based on your lifestyle data:\n\n**Ranked Intervention Domains:**\n\n1.  **Positivity**\n2.  **Exercise**\n3.  **Diet / Sleep** (Tied for last, as no relevant variables were found in the provided data for these domains that match the allowed list).\n\n---\n\n**1. Positivity (Rank 1)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThis domain ranks first due to `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 3), which is the highest-ranked relevant variable across all domains. The mean `Connect_satisfaction` is low, especially in the high depression group (3.000 out of 5), which explicitly prioritizes this variable according to the rules (ignoring its medium negative correlation of -0.314). While `Connect_chatpeople` (Rank 5) shows a positive correlation (0.105), incurring a penalty, the strong impact and prioritization of `Connect_satisfaction` make Positivity the most impactful domain for intervention. This suggests that the *quality* and *satisfaction* of social connections are more crucial than the *number* of people chatted with.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n*   **Focus on Meaningful Connections:** Prioritize interactions that genuinely enhance your sense of connection and well-being.\n    *   **Actionable:** \"Aim to have at least one genuinely satisfying social interaction each day. This could be a thoughtful conversation with a close friend or a brief, meaningful chat with a family member, focusing on quality over quantity of interactions.\"\n\n---\n\n**2. Exercise (Rank 2)**\n\n**Justification:**\nExercise is ranked second due to the presence of two relevant variables. `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 6) exhibits a medium negative correlation (-0.260) with depression, indicating that increased moderate exercise is associated with lower depression. Individuals with low depression reported engaging in more moderate exercise (0.432 hours) compared to those with high depression (0.324 hours). `past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 4) also shows a negative correlation (-0.043), though its strength is considered weak (within the [-0.2, 0.2] range, so its magnitude is ignored for prioritization).\n\n**Recommendations:**\n*   **Gradually Increase Moderate Exercise:** Focus on activities that get your heart rate up without being overly strenuous.\n    *   **Actionable:** \"Start by adding 15-20 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, like a brisk walk, cycling, or active chores, three times a week. Gradually work towards incorporating this level of activity more consistently into your routine, aiming for around 45 minutes on most days if feasible.\"\n\n---\n\n**3. Diet / Sleep (Rank 3/4 - Tied)**\n\n**Justification:**\nNo relevant variables from the allowed list were found in the provided data for either the Diet ('Diet_satisfaction', 'past_day_fats', 'past_day_sugars') or Sleep ('Sleep_percent', 'Sleep_satisfaction') domains. As per the instructions, domains with no relevant variables are automatically ranked last.\n\n**Recommendations (General, as no data-specific insights):**\n*   **Diet:** Focus on balanced nutrition for overall well-being.\n    *   **Actionable:** \"Consider incorporating more whole foods, fruits, and vegetables into your meals. Try a simple dietary change, like adding an extra serving of vegetables to lunch or dinner.\"\n*   **Sleep:** Prioritize consistent and restful sleep.\n    *   **Actionable:** \"Establish a regular bedtime and wake-up schedule, even on weekends. Aim to create a relaxing routine before bed, such as reading or light stretching, to signal to your body it's time to unwind.\""
