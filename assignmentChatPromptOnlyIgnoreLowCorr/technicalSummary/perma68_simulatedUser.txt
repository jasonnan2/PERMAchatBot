Exercise**\n\n*   **Justification:** Exercise is ranked first primarily due to `Exercise_satisfaction` (Rank 3). This variable shows significantly lower satisfaction in individuals with high depression (2.222) compared to those with low depression (2.629). According to the prioritization rules, domains with low satisfaction values are prioritized regardless of correlation, making this a crucial area for intervention. Additionally, it has a medium negative correlation to depression (-0.2856), further supporting its importance. While `cumm_step_speed` (Rank 5) shows a positive correlation (0.3790), meaning higher speed is associated with higher depression, and other exercise variables like `cumm_step_calorie`, `cumm_step_distance`, and `cumm_step_count` (Ranks 4, 6, 7) have weak negative correlations and are thus ignored, the high rank and low satisfaction for `Exercise_satisfaction` makes this domain the most impactful.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Focus on enjoyable activity:** Identify and engage in physical activities you genuinely enjoy, even for short durations (e.g., 15-20 minutes). The goal is to improve satisfaction, not just quantity or intensity.\n    *   **Prioritize consistency over speed:** Instead of pushing for high speed, aim for consistent, moderate movement daily, such as brisk walking.\n\n**2. Sleep**\n\n*   **Justification:** Sleep is ranked second due to the high rank of `Sleep_wakeuptime` (Rank 2). This variable has a positive correlation (0.2739), indicating that later wake-up times are associated with higher depression (High Depression: 06:29 vs. Low Depression: 05:37). While this positive correlation incurs a penalty, the high rank of the variable suggests it's a significant factor in depression. `Sleep_bedtime` (Rank 10) also shows a later bedtime in the high depression group (22:29 vs. 21:37), but its correlation is weak negative (-0.1520) and is therefore ignored. The challenge here is making actionable recommendations from a positive correlation, but the data clearly links later wake-up to higher depression.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Establish a consistent wake-up time:** Gradually adjust your wake-up time to be 15-30 minutes earlier each day until you achieve a consistent schedule, even on weekends.\n    *   **Create a relaxing bedtime routine:** Aim to go to bed at a similar time each night, and implement calming activities before bed to help you wind down.\n\n**3. Diet**\n\n*   **Justification:** No relevant variables for the Diet domain were found in the provided dataset.\n*   **Recommendations:** (None can be provided based on the given data)\n\n**4. Positivity**\n\n*   **Justification:** No relevant variables for the Positivity domain were found in the provided dataset.\n*   **Recommendations:** (None can be provided based on the given data)"
