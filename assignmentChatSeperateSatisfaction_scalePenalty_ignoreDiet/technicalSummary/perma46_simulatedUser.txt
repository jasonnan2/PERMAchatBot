Exercise (Rank 1)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Exercise domain is ranked highest due to multiple highly-ranked actionable variables that show clear opportunities for improvement.\n*   **`past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 5)**: This is the highest-ranked actionable variable in any domain. During high depression, the mean moderate exercise is 1.259 hours, significantly lower than 3.015 hours during low depression. Although its correlation is weak negative (-0.191), the substantial difference in means strongly indicates a need for intervention.\n*   **`past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 6)**: Similar to moderate exercise, mild exercise is 0.667 hours during high depression compared to 1.364 hours during low depression. It shows a medium negative correlation (-0.246), further supporting its importance.\n*   **`exercise_calorie` (Rank 9)**: While it has a weak positive correlation (0.157), the instructions state not to penalize its directionality. Its rank is still high.\n*   **`Exercise_satisfaction` (Rank 10)**: Shows a medium negative correlation (-0.261), indicating that higher satisfaction with exercise is linked to lower depression.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nFocus on gradually increasing both moderate and mild physical activity.\n*   **Increase Moderate Activity:** Aim to incorporate an additional 1-2 hours of moderate exercise per day. This could include activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, which are significantly lower during periods of high depression.\n*   **Boost Mild Activity:** Try to add an extra 30-60 minutes of mild exercise daily, such as light stretching, gentle walks, or active household chores, to help bridge the gap seen in the data.\n\n---\n\n**2. Positivity (Rank 2)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThis domain is ranked second due to a powerful negative correlation in Gratitude and low satisfaction in social connection, both at high ranks.\n*   **`Gratitude` (Rank 8)**: This variable exhibits a strong negative correlation (-0.419) with depression. The mean gratitude score is significantly lower during high depression (2.714) compared to low depression (4.625), highlighting a critical area for intervention.\n*   **`Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 7)**: Shows low satisfaction during high depression (2.630) and a medium negative correlation (-0.307). This domain also received an extra prioritization boost because `Connect_satisfaction` was low and `Gratitude` was another actionable variable present in the correct direction.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nActively cultivate gratitude and seek opportunities for meaningful social connection.\n*   **Practice Daily Gratitude:** Dedicate a few minutes each day to writing down 3-5 things you are grateful for. This practice can significantly shift your perspective and improve mood, as suggested by the strong negative correlation with depression.\n*   **Enhance Social Connections:** Make a conscious effort to engage with others. This could involve reaching out to a friend or family member for a brief conversation, joining a community group, or participating in activities that foster positive social interactions.\n\n---\n\n**3. Sleep (Rank 3)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Sleep domain is ranked third because `Sleep_satisfaction` is notably low, indicating a personal area of struggle, but it's the only actionable variable present for this domain, and it has a lower overall rank.\n*   **`Sleep_satisfaction` (Rank 27)**: While its rank is relatively low, indicating less overall importance compared to other variables, the mean satisfaction during high depression (2.074) is very low, suggesting poor perceived sleep quality. In low depression, it's slightly higher at 2.485, and it has a weak negative correlation (-0.163). This domain did not qualify for the special low-satisfaction prioritization rule as there were no *other* actionable sleep variables (like `Sleep_percent`) found in the data.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nFocus on improving your subjective experience of sleep quality.\n*   **Consistent Sleep Routine:** Establish and maintain a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends.\n*   **Optimize Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using earplugs or an eye mask if necessary.\n*   **Relaxing Bedtime Ritual:** Implement a calming routine before bed, such as reading, light stretching, or taking a warm bath, to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.\n\n---\n\n**4. Diet (Rank 4)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Diet domain is ranked last because the dataset did not contain any specific actionable variables related to `past_day_fats` or `past_day_sugars`.\n*   **`Diet_satisfaction` (Rank 28)**: While present, its mean value during high depression (3.222) is not low enough to trigger the special prioritization criteria for low satisfaction. With no other actionable variables to guide specific dietary recommendations from this data, this domain is ranked last according to the defined rules.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nWhile the provided data does not offer specific actionable dietary variables for targeted intervention, maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet is universally beneficial for overall health and mood.\n*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Focus on a diet rich in whole foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n*   **Mindful Eating:** Pay attention to your eating patterns and how different foods make you feel to promote overall well-being."
