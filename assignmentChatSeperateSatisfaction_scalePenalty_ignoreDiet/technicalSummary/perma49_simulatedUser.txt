Exercise Domain**\n*   **Justification:** This domain presents the most significant opportunity for intervention.\n    *   'past_day_exercise_moderate' (Rank 6, Correlation: -0.385) shows a medium-to-strong negative correlation with depression. Importantly, the mean value for moderate exercise is 0.000 hours during high depression, indicating a critical lack of this activity. Increasing moderate exercise offers a direct pathway to potentially reduce depression.\n    *   'Exercise_satisfaction' (Rank 17, Correlation: -0.249) is notably low at 1.250 in high depression, suggesting that current exercise experiences are not enjoyable. Improving satisfaction here, even with a higher rank, is vital for long-term adherence.\n    *   'past_day_exercise_mild' (Rank 10, Correlation: 0.072) shows slightly higher engagement in low depression states, reinforcing the general benefit of physical activity.\n*   **Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**\n    *   **Gradually increase moderate-intensity physical activity:** Start with short, manageable bouts (e.g., 10-15 minutes, 3 times a week) of brisk walking, cycling, or active chores. The goal is to slowly build up duration and frequency, aiming for a small but consistent increase from the current near-zero levels during high depression.\n    *   **Explore enjoyable forms of exercise to boost satisfaction:** Experiment with different activities like dancing, hiking, yoga, or recreational sports to find what genuinely resonates. Improving 'Exercise_satisfaction' (currently 1.250 in high depression) is key for sustainable engagement.\n\n**2. Diet Domain**\n*   **Justification:** This domain is a high priority due to its top-ranked variable and low satisfaction.\n    *   'past_day_fats' (Rank 1, Correlation: -0.187) is the highest-ranked variable in your data. While the correlation is weak, the mean fat intake is lower in high depression (1.125) compared to low depression (1.800). Following the guidance to advise healthier fats, this indicates an opportunity to improve diet quality.\n    *   'Diet_satisfaction' (Rank 3, Correlation: -0.271) is critically low (1.625 in high depression) and exhibits a medium negative correlation, suggesting that improving how much you enjoy your diet can significantly impact depression levels.\n*   **Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**\n    *   **Incorporate healthier sources of fats:** Focus on replacing less healthy fats with options rich in beneficial fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds (e.g., chia, flax), and olive oil. For example, add a quarter of an avocado to a meal or snack on a small handful of almonds daily.\n    *   **Explore ways to enhance your enjoyment and satisfaction with meals:** Experiment with new healthy recipes, try different spices or fresh herbs, or practice mindful eating by savoring each bite. The aim is to make eating a more pleasurable experience, which can directly improve 'Diet_satisfaction' (currently 1.625 in high depression).\n\n**3. Positivity Domain**\n*   **Justification:** This domain offers a clear area for improvement in connection, but a conflicting signal in reflection.\n    *   'Connect_satisfaction' (Rank 7, Correlation: -0.227) is very low (1.250 in high depression) and shows a medium negative correlation, indicating that increasing satisfaction with social connections could reduce depression.\n    *   'Reflect_activetime' (Rank 9, Correlation: 0.220) presents a challenge. It has a positive correlation with depression and is *higher* during periods of high depression (4054.000 msec) compared to low depression (1602.500 msec). This suggests that prolonged or certain types of active reflection might be counterproductive or associated with increased depressive states, incurring a penalty for the domain.\n*   **Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**\n    *   **Actively seek opportunities for social connection and interaction:** Make a conscious effort to reach out to friends or family, even for a brief conversation. Consider joining a social group, club, or volunteer activity to enhance your 'Connect_satisfaction' (currently 1.250 in high depression).\n    *   **Re-evaluate and adjust your approach to self-reflection:** Given that 'Reflect_activetime' is higher in high depression and positively correlated, consider if your current reflection practices involve dwelling on negative thoughts. Try shifting towards structured, brief, and solution-focused reflection (e.g., journaling about solutions rather than problems), or incorporate gratitude practices, limiting unstructured active reflection.\n\n**4. Sleep Domain**\n*   **Justification:** This domain is ranked last because the only actionable variable, 'Sleep_satisfaction', shows a counter-intuitive pattern.\n    *   'Sleep_satisfaction' (Rank 14, Correlation: 0.001) is *higher* during periods of high depression (2.062) compared to low depression (1.667). This lack of a \"correct direction\" for intervention (where increasing satisfaction would lead to decreased depression) means this domain is not a priority based on the provided data. According to the instructions, if a domain has no actionable variables in the correct direction, it is ranked last.\n*   **Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**\n    *   **Focus on general sleep hygiene practices:** Despite the counter-intuitive 'Sleep_satisfaction' data, establishing consistent sleep habits is universally beneficial. This includes maintaining a regular sleep and wake schedule (even on weekends), creating a relaxing bedtime routine (e.g., warm bath, reading), ensuring your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and cool, and avoiding caffeine or heavy meals close to bedtime."
