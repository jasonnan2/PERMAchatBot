Exercise Domain**\n\n*   **Justification:** This domain is ranked highest due to multiple highly-ranked actionable variables showing a strong association with lower depression. `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 3, CORR -0.38) and `past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 4, CORR -0.29) both demonstrate a medium-to-strong negative correlation with depression. Individuals experience significantly less moderate and mild exercise during high depression (0.048 hrs moderate, 0.403 hrs mild) compared to low depression (0.180 hrs moderate, 0.750 hrs mild). Additionally, `exercise_calorie` (Rank 8) shows a notable decrease during high depression (17.0 kCal) versus low depression (44.022 kCal), further supporting the impact of physical activity. `Exercise_satisfaction` (Rank 12, CORR -0.26) also shows a medium negative correlation, indicating that higher satisfaction is linked to lower depression. No penalties were incurred in this domain.\n\n*   **Specific Recommendations:**\n    *   Gradually increase the duration of `past_day_exercise_mild` activities, such as light walks or gentle stretching, aiming for an increase from current levels (0.403 hrs) towards those seen in low depression states (0.750 hrs).\n    *   Incorporate more `past_day_exercise_moderate` activities, like brisk walking or cycling, starting with small increments to build up from 0.048 hours.\n    *   Focus on consistency in physical activity to collectively increase `exercise_calorie` expenditure.\n\n**2. Positivity Domain**\n\n*   **Justification:** This domain is highly ranked because `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 7, CORR -0.37) shows a medium negative correlation with depression and, critically, the mean satisfaction during high depression (2.419) is notably low (below 3 out of 5). This satisfies the prioritization rule for domains with low satisfaction values. This indicates that lower satisfaction with connections is strongly associated with higher depression. No penalties were incurred.\n\n*   **Specific Recommendations:**\n    *   Actively seek out opportunities to improve your `Connect_satisfaction`. This could involve reaching out to friends or family, joining a community group, or participating in shared activities.\n\n**3. Diet Domain**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Diet domain has one actionable variable, `past_day_fats` (Rank 5, CORR -0.22), which shows a medium negative correlation with depression. The data indicates that individuals consume less fats during high depression (1.226 portions) compared to low depression (1.750 portions). While the directionality of 'fats' does not incur a penalty, conventional health advice suggests focusing on healthy fat intake. `Diet_satisfaction` (Rank 15) is not overall low and its rank is above 11, so it does not factor into prioritization for low satisfaction.\n\n*   **Specific Recommendations:**\n    *   Focus on increasing your intake of healthy `past_day_fats` through sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, aiming to increase from current levels (1.226 portions).\n\n**4. Sleep Domain**\n\n*   **Justification:** Despite `Sleep_satisfaction` being a high-ranked variable (Rank 2), its correlation to depression (-0.0019) is negligible (weak, ignored as per rules). Furthermore, the mean `Sleep_satisfaction` is slightly *higher* during high depression (3.194) than low depression (3.062). This counter-intuitive direction suggests that simply increasing \"sleep satisfaction\" might not be an effective lever for reducing depression in this individual, and it incurs a significant penalty due to this problematic correlation and being the only actionable variable in the domain. `Sleep_duration` (Rank 9) is not an actionable variable per the instructions. `Sleep_percent` is not in the data, so no penalty for that.\n\n*   **Specific Recommendations:**\n    *   Based on the data, directly targeting `Sleep_satisfaction` is not recommended as a primary intervention for depression reduction for this individual, given the counter-intuitive correlation. Consider exploring other aspects of sleep (e.g., consistency, environment) that are not captured or actionable in this dataset if sleep issues persist."
