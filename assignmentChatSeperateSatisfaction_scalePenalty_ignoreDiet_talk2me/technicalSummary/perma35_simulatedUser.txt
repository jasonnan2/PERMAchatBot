Exercise (Rank 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This domain stands out with the highest-ranked actionable variable, `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 3), which shows a strong negative correlation (-0.425) with depression. During periods of high depression, your moderate exercise significantly drops (0.083 hours) compared to low depression (0.538 hours). Additionally, `heart_rate` (Rank 7) is slightly higher during low depression periods (92.638 bpm vs 90.734 bpm), suggesting that activities increasing heart rate can be beneficial. These multiple, impactful variables with clear directionality make Exercise the most promising domain for intervention. `Exercise_satisfaction` is lower in high depression, but its high rank (23) means it doesn't heavily influence the overall domain priority.\n\n**2. Sleep (Rank 2)**\n*   **Analysis:** The `Sleep_satisfaction` variable (Rank 4) is a highly-ranked, actionable variable with a strong negative correlation (-0.409) to depression. Your sleep satisfaction is notably lower during high depression (3.926) compared to low depression (4.515). This indicates a clear link between your perceived sleep quality and mood. While `Sleep_duration` cannot be changed per the instructions, focusing on satisfaction offers a tangible area for improvement. This domain has strong indicators without any penalties.\n\n**3. Positivity (Rank 3)**\n*   **Analysis:** This domain contains variables that, based on your data, present challenges for straightforward \"positive\" interventions. `Gratitude` (Rank 6) shows a positive correlation (0.298) with depression, which is counter-intuitive for reducing depression. Similarly, `Connect_chattime` (Rank 10) is actually higher during high depression (0.370 hours) than low depression (0.311 hours), suggesting that *more* chattime is associated with *higher* depression. These counter-intuitive findings for relatively high-ranked variables incur significant penalties, positioning Positivity lower despite `Connect_satisfaction` being slightly lower in high depression.\n\n**4. Diet (Rank 4)**\n*   **Analysis:** While `Diet_satisfaction` (Rank 9) shows a medium negative correlation (-0.259) and is lower during high depression (4.444 vs 4.697), the provided data lacks any other specific actionable variables for diet (like `past_day_fats` or `past_day_sugars`). According to the guidelines, without specific actionable variables in the correct direction, this domain is ranked last.\n\n---\n\n**Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the analysis, your primary focus should be on **Exercise**, followed by **Sleep**.\n\n**Primary Focus: Exercise**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Gradually increase your engagement in moderate-intensity exercise.\n*   **Justification:** Your data clearly shows a significant reduction in `past_day_exercise_moderate` during high depression (0.083 hours vs. 0.538 hours in low depression), with a strong negative correlation (Rank 3, -0.425) to depression. Increasing your activity can directly combat depressive symptoms.\n*   **Specific Actions:**\n    *   **Start Small:** Begin with short, achievable bursts of moderate exercise, such as a 15-minute brisk walk, light jogging, or cycling, three times a week.\n    *   **Consistent Activity:** Aim to gradually increase your `past_day_exercise_moderate` to at least 30 minutes, most days of the week, as tolerated. Focus on consistency over intensity initially.\n    *   **Monitor Heart Rate:** Engage in activities that gently elevate your `heart_rate` to a moderate level, which is associated with lower depression in your data.\n\n**Secondary Focus: Sleep**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Implement strategies to improve your overall `Sleep_satisfaction`.\n*   **Justification:** Your `Sleep_satisfaction` is a highly influential factor (Rank 4, -0.409 correlation), showing a notable decline during high depression (3.926) compared to low depression (4.515). Enhancing your perceived quality of sleep can have a significant positive impact on your mood.\n*   **Specific Actions:**\n    *   **Consistent Schedule:** Establish a regular sleep-wake schedule, even on weekends, to regulate your internal body clock.\n    *   **Wind-Down Routine:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine to prepare your mind and body for sleep. This could include reading, a warm bath, or gentle stretching.\n    *   **Optimize Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool, and avoid screens for at least an hour before bed."
