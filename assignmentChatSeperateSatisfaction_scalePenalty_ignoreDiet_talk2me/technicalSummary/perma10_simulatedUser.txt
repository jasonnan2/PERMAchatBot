Sleep (Rank 1)**\n\n*   **Variables:** `Sleep_satisfaction` (rank 3), `Sleep_percent` (rank 9).\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   **Prioritization due to low satisfaction:** Your `Sleep_satisfaction` is consistently low (Mean high depression: 2.062; Mean low depression: 1.926) out of a possible 5. This low satisfaction, coupled with `Sleep_percent` showing a positive directionality (low depression group averages 74.630% sleep efficiency compared to 68.750% in high depression), triggers the rule to prioritize this domain.\n    *   **Penalties:** `Sleep_satisfaction` has a positive correlation to depression (0.221). This means higher reported satisfaction is slightly associated with higher depression, which is counter-intuitive and incurs a penalty due to its high rank (3). However, the explicit rule to prioritize domains with low satisfaction and at least one other actionable variable in the correct direction places Sleep as the top priority.\n    *   `Sleep_percent` is below the 80% threshold, so no penalty there.\n\n**2. Positivity (Rank 2)**\n\n*   **Variables:** `Connect_chatpeople` (rank 7), `Reflect_activetime` (rank 8), `Gratitude` (rank 10).\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   **Multiple Positive Indicators:** This domain presents several variables trending in a beneficial direction. All three actionable variables are present and show positive trends.\n    *   **Strongest Correlation:** `Gratitude` (rank 10) shows the strongest beneficial correlation in your data (-0.248, a medium negative correlation). This indicates that higher gratitude scores are associated with lower depression.\n    *   `Connect_chatpeople` (rank 7) and `Reflect_activetime` (rank 8) also show favorable mean differences (higher in low depression groups), indicating that more social connections and reflective time are associated with lower depression.\n    *   **No Penalties:** This domain does not incur any penalties.\n\n**3. Exercise (Rank 3)**\n\n*   **Variables:** `cumm_step_distance` (rank 5).\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   **Limited Actionable Data:** Only one actionable exercise variable (`cumm_step_distance`) was present in the provided dataset.\n    *   **Positive Direction, Weak Correlation:** `cumm_step_distance` (rank 5) shows a positive directionality (low depression group averages 251.086 meters compared to 105.893 meters in high depression), but its correlation to depression is weak (-0.026).\n    *   `Exercise_satisfaction` (rank 20) is high (Mean around 4.7) and shows a weak, problematic positive correlation, offering no prioritization.\n\n**4. Diet (Rank 4)**\n\n*   **Variables:** None of the specified actionable variables (`past_day_fats`, `past_day_sugars`) were found in the provided data.\n*   **Justification:** As no actionable variables for the Diet domain were present in the data, this domain automatically ranks last.\n\n---\n\n### Specific, Actionable Recommendations\n\n**1. Sleep (Priority: High)**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Focus on improving your **`Sleep_percent` (sleep efficiency)**. Aim to spend your time in bed actually sleeping. This can be achieved by:\n    *   Ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n    *   Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.\n    *   Avoiding stimulating activities, heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime.\n*   **Note:** While your `Sleep_satisfaction` is low, the data suggests that simply *feeling* more satisfied isn't directly correlated with lower depression in your case. Therefore, focus on objective improvements in sleep quality and efficiency.\n\n**2. Positivity (Priority: Medium)**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Actively engage in practices that foster positive emotions and connections:\n    *   **Increase `Gratitude`:** Dedicate time each day to reflect on things you are grateful for. This could involve keeping a gratitude journal or verbally sharing your gratitude with others.\n    *   **Increase `Reflect_activetime`:** Integrate short periods of reflection or mindfulness into your day. This could be a few minutes of quiet contemplation, meditation, or journaling about your thoughts and feelings.\n    *   **Increase `Connect_chatpeople`:** Make an effort to connect with more individuals. This doesn't necessarily mean long conversations, but rather reaching out to different people for brief chats or interactions.\n\n**3. Exercise (Priority: Medium-Low)**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Incrementally increase your **`cumm_step_distance`**.\n    *   Incorporate more walking into your daily routine. Consider taking the stairs, parking further away, or going for short walks during breaks.\n    *   Even small, consistent increases in your daily steps can contribute to improved well-being.\n\n**4. Diet (Priority: Low)**\n\n*   **Recommendation:** Based on the provided data, there are no actionable variables for `past_day_fats` or `past_day_sugars`. Therefore, no specific recommendations regarding your diet can be made at this time."
