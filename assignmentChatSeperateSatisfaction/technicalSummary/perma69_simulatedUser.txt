        "content": "Here's an analysis of your lifestyle data, ranking intervention domains to reduce depression, along with actionable recommendations:\n\n**Overall Domain Ranking (1 = Most Important, 4 = Least Important):**\n\n1.  **Sleep**\n2.  **Exercise**\n3.  **Positivity**\n4.  **Diet**\n\n---\n\n**1. Sleep**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Sleep domain ranks highest primarily due to `Sleep_satisfaction`. Although its rank is 12 (which is ignored for ranking due to being 11 or above), its mean satisfaction score of **2.704** during high depression is low on a 1-5 scale. This triggers a specific prioritization rule for domains with low satisfaction values. Furthermore, `Sleep_satisfaction` has a medium negative correlation of **-0.3215**, indicating that higher sleep satisfaction is strongly associated with lower depression. This clear, actionable variable with a beneficial correlation and low current satisfaction makes Sleep the top priority.\n*   **Recommendation:** Focus on improving the quality of your sleep to enhance satisfaction.\n    *   **Actionable suggestion:** Implement a consistent, relaxing pre-sleep routine 15-30 minutes before bed, such as reading a book, listening to calming music, or performing gentle stretches. Ensure your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and cool.\n\n---\n\n**2. Exercise**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Exercise domain presents multiple actionable variables with beneficial trends. `past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 4) shows that individuals with low depression engage in more mild exercise (0.250 hours) compared to those with high depression (0.213 hours). While its correlation is weak (-0.0439), the directional difference is positive. More significantly, `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 6) has a medium negative correlation of **-0.2608**, with low depression correlating to more moderate exercise (0.432 hours vs. 0.324 hours in high depression). The presence of two actionable variables showing positive associations with lower depression, with one having a medium correlation, makes Exercise a strong intervention area.\n*   **Recommendation:** Gradually increase both mild and moderate physical activity throughout your week.\n    *   **Actionable suggestion:** Incorporate an extra 10-15 minutes of brisk walking or light activity into your daily routine, perhaps during a lunch break or by taking the stairs. Additionally, aim to add 15-20 minutes of moderate activity, such as cycling or sustained active chores, most days of the week.\n\n---\n\n**3. Positivity**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Positivity domain has one actionable variable, `Connect_chatpeople` (Rank 5). This variable shows a positive correlation of **0.1050**, with a higher mean in the high depression group (0.519 people) compared to the low depression group (0.303 people). This indicates that a higher number of chat interactions is associated with *increased* depression for this individual, which is an adverse finding. This positive correlation incurs a significant penalty because it is the only actionable variable for this domain. While `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 3) has a medium negative correlation (-0.3144), its mean (3.000 in high depression) is not low enough to trigger prioritization, and it is not an actionable variable for specific behavioral change.\n*   **Recommendation:** Focus on enhancing the quality rather than just the quantity of social interactions, particularly online.\n    *   **Actionable suggestion:** Prioritize deeper, more meaningful conversations or in-person interactions with a few trusted individuals. Reflect on how different types of social connections make you feel and aim to engage in those that are more supportive and uplifting.\n\n---\n\n**4. Diet**\n\n*   **Justification:** The Diet domain includes `past_day_fats` and `past_day_sugars` as actionable variables. However, neither of these variables were present in the provided data.\n*   **Recommendation:** No specific recommendations can be provided from the given data. However, adopting a generally balanced and healthy eating pattern is always beneficial for overall well-being.\n    *   **Actionable suggestion:** Focus on incorporating more whole foods, fresh fruits, and vegetables into your daily meals as a general healthy practice."
