Exercise Domain (Rank 1)**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This domain shows the most significant potential for positive impact.\n    *   `past_day_exercise_moderate` (Rank 4, CORR -0.476): A strong negative correlation indicates that more moderate exercise is associated with lower depression. Individuals with high depression average 0.250 hours, compared to 0.481 hours for low depression.\n    *   `cumm_step_count` (Rank 7, CORR -0.573): A strong negative correlation shows a clear link between higher step counts and lower depression. High depression averages 1438 steps, while low depression averages 3232 steps.\n    *   `cumm_step_calorie` (Rank 10, CORR -0.574): This also has a strong negative correlation, reinforcing that increased activity (calories burned through steps) is beneficial. High depression averages 51.66 kcal, compared to 115.83 kcal for low depression.\n    *   `Exercise_satisfaction` (Rank 16, MEAN 2.636 in high depression): The satisfaction score is low, further highlighting this as a critical area for intervention.\n    *   `past_day_exercise_mild` (Rank 2, CORR 0.223): While high-ranked, this variable shows a weak positive correlation, indicating that more mild exercise is associated with higher depression (0.227 hrs in high depression vs 0.096 hrs in low). This is a minor detractor but heavily outweighed by the other strong negative correlations.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Increase Moderate Exercise:** Aim to increase your moderate exercise duration. Try to gradually achieve at least **0.5 hours (30 minutes)** of moderate exercise per day.\n    *   **Boost Daily Step Count:** Work towards increasing your daily steps, targeting approximately **3000-3500 steps** per day, as observed in periods of lower depression. This will naturally increase calories burned through steps.\n\n**2. Positivity Domain (Rank 2)**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This domain also presents meaningful opportunities for intervention, particularly in social connection.\n    *   `Connect_chattime` (Rank 8, CORR -0.306): A medium negative correlation suggests that more chat time is associated with lower depression. High depression shows 0.235 hours of chat, versus 0.404 hours in low depression.\n    *   `Reflect_activetime` (Rank 9): While the correlation value provided ('33') is invalid, the mean values indicate that higher reflection time is associated with lower depression (8011 msec in low depression vs 6429 msec in high depression). This suggests a positive relationship.\n    *   `Connect_satisfaction` (Rank 28, MEAN 2.576 in high depression): A significantly low satisfaction score indicates a strong need to improve social connections.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Increase Social Connection Time:** Actively seek out opportunities for social interaction and dedicate more time to chatting with others. Aim for around **0.4 hours (24 minutes)** of chat time per day.\n    *   **Engage in Reflection:** Dedicate more time to reflective activities. Aim to increase your active reflection time towards **8000 msec (approximately 8 seconds)** daily.\n\n**3. Diet Domain (Rank 3)**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This domain is ranked lower due to limitations in actionable insights based on the provided data and rules.\n    *   `past_day_fats` (Rank 6, CORR -0.114): This variable has a negative correlation, meaning higher fat intake is associated with lower depression. According to the rules, we must prioritize positive correlations (lower fat leading to lower depression) and penalize negative correlations for this variable. This correlation directly contradicts the goal of promoting healthy lifestyle changes by advising lower fat intake, therefore it incurs a penalty and does not support actionable recommendations to reduce fats.\n    *   `Diet_satisfaction` (Rank 22, MEAN 3.242 in high depression): The satisfaction score is not considered low (<3), so it does not prioritize this domain for intervention.\n*   **Recommendations:** Based on the data and the explicit instruction \"Do not advise higher sugar or fat intake,\" and the negative correlation observed for `past_day_fats` (suggesting *higher* fat with *lower* depression), no actionable recommendation can be made here that aligns with conventional healthy eating guidance to reduce fats/sugars. Further investigation into specific dietary components beyond just fat/sugar would be needed.\n\n**4. Sleep Domain (Rank 4)**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This domain is ranked last because no actionable variables could be identified according to the given rules.\n    *   `Sleep_bedtime` (Rank 3): This variable is explicitly excluded from actionable change.\n    *   `Sleep_satisfaction` (Rank 20, CORR -0.182, MEAN 3.788 in high depression): The correlation is within the [-0.2, 0.2] range, which means it should be ignored. Furthermore, the satisfaction score of 3.788 is not considered \"low satisfaction\" (<3), therefore it does not trigger prioritization for this domain. `Sleep_percent` was not provided in the data.\n*   **Recommendations:** No specific actionable recommendations can be made for sleep based on the provided data and variable limitations."
