My recommendations prioritize positive lifestyle modifications and align with the most impactful variables identified.\n\n**Ranked Intervention Domains:**\n\n1.  **Diet**\n2.  **Positivity**\n3.  **Exercise**\n4.  **Sleep**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Diet (Rank 1)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Diet domain is ranked highest primarily due to **Diet_satisfaction** (Rank 4). Individuals experiencing high depression report significantly lower diet satisfaction (Mean 3.304) compared to those with low depression (Mean 3.861), with a medium negative correlation (-0.2477). This low satisfaction score, combined with its high rank (within the top 10), strongly prioritizes this domain for intervention.\nWhile **past_day_fats** (Rank 5, Correlation -0.1301) is also a highly ranked variable, the data shows that lower fat intake is associated with higher depression (High Depression Mean: 1.348 portions vs. Low Depression Mean: 1.694 portions). According to the rules, a negative correlation for fats implies increasing fats might decrease depression, which is contrary to the desired positive lifestyle change of reducing unhealthy fats. This variable, therefore, incurs a penalty to the domain's overall strength and will not be part of a recommendation to increase fat intake. The focus remains on improving overall diet quality for satisfaction.\n\n**Specific Actionable Recommendations:**\n*   **Improve Diet Quality for Satisfaction:** Focus on incorporating more nutrient-dense foods that you genuinely enjoy. Since your `Diet_satisfaction` is low during periods of high depression (3.304), explore meal planning or cooking new, healthy recipes that you find appealing. Aim for small, sustainable changes like adding one extra serving of vegetables daily or trying a new whole-grain food.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Positivity (Rank 2)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Positivity domain is highly impactful, featuring two high-ranked variables with medium negative correlations. **Gratitude** (Rank 3, Correlation -0.2968) shows significantly lower practice during periods of high depression (Mean 4.833) compared to low depression (Mean 5.333). Similarly, **Connect_satisfaction** (Rank 7, Correlation -0.2045) is lower when depression is high (Mean 4.174 vs. 4.500). Both variables indicate that increasing these activities is associated with reduced depression, with no conflicting signals or penalties. Its highest-ranked variable `Gratitude` is the top actionable variable overall.\n\n**Specific Actionable Recommendations:**\n*   **Cultivate Gratitude:** Start a daily gratitude practice. This could involve spending 5-10 minutes each morning or evening thinking about or writing down 3-5 things you are grateful for.\n*   **Enhance Social Connection Satisfaction:** Identify social interactions that make you feel truly connected and fulfilled. Prioritize quality over quantity. This might mean reaching out to a close friend or family member for a meaningful chat or dedicating time to community activities you value, aiming for more satisfying interactions rather than just more interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Exercise (Rank 3)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Exercise domain presents two significant, high-ranked variables. **past_day_exercise_moderate** (Rank 9, Correlation -0.3224) shows notably lower engagement during high depression (Mean 0.087 hours) compared to low depression (Mean 0.306 hours). **past_day_exercise_strenuous** (Rank 6, Correlation -0.2360) also follows this pattern (High Depression Mean: 0.293 hours vs. Low Depression Mean: 0.542 hours). Both indicate that increased exercise intensity and duration are associated with lower depression, with `past_day_exercise_moderate` having the strongest negative correlation among all identified actionable variables. No penalties were incurred in this domain.\n\n**Specific Actionable Recommendations:**\n*   **Increase Moderate Exercise:** Gradually increase your moderate exercise by aiming for an extra 10-15 minutes of brisk walking, cycling, or active chores most days of the week. Start with what feels manageable and build up over time.\n*   **Incorporate Strenuous Activity:** Consider adding short bursts of more strenuous exercise. This could be jogging for 15-20 minutes, a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session, or a challenging hike once or twice a week, based on your current fitness level and doctor's advice.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Sleep (Rank 4)**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Sleep domain is ranked last due to the lack of strong actionable variables in the provided data. **Sleep_satisfaction** (Rank 18, Correlation -0.0164) is the only actionable variable, but its low rank (above 10), weak correlation, and mean satisfaction score (3.652 in high depression, not considered \"low satisfaction\") indicate minimal impact. Other sleep variables like Sleep_bedtime and sleep_duration were not actionable or present.\n\n**Specific Actionable Recommendations:**\n*   **General Sleep Hygiene:** While the data doesn't highlight sleep as a primary driver, maintaining good sleep hygiene is foundational for overall well-being. Focus on consistent bedtimes and wake times, creating a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment, and winding down with relaxing activities before bed to generally support your sleep."
